Imagine going to the seller knowing not only the condition of all parts of the vehicle, but also some trouble spots that even the seller may honestly not know. Even if you do not purchase it, the seller now can know the invaluable information on the coming future problems on the vehicle.

What if you don’t have all the photos? That is ok, provide as many as you have (up to 5). But then Julia may not be able to provide you with a detailed report on the car.

*For a motorcycle, only 2 photos is enough, one from each side of it.
